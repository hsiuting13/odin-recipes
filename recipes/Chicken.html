        <h1>Chinese Dong'an Chicken</h1>
        <img src="../recipes-pictures/chicken.jpg" alt="Chinese Dong'an Chicken">
        <p>This is a classic Hunan chicken dish, which is simple and delicious. A parboiled chicken is chopped up, 
            then stir-fried with chiles, ginger, Szechuan peppercorns, and vinegar.</p>
        <p id="ingredients">Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) whole chicken</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped dried chile peppers</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vinegar</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons rice wine</li>
            <li>20 Szechuan peppercorns, crushed</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>2 spring onions, chopped, or more to taste</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="steps">Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken in a stockpot with water to cover; bring to a boil and cook until juices run clear, 
                at least 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest
                 part of the thigh near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
                Remove chicken; set aside to cool. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken meat from bone; cut meat into 1/2-inch by 2-inch strips.
                 Mix cornstarch and cold water together in a small bowl. Toss meat in 1/2 of the cornstarch mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add chicken mixture, ginger, and chiles; 
                cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add reserved cooking liquid, vinegar, rice wine, peppercorns, and salt. Return to boil; 
                cook and stir until mixture is almost dry, about 3 minutes. 
                Stir in spring onions, monosodium glutamate, and remaining cornstarch mixture; cook until sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes more. 
                Drizzle with sesame oil.</li>
        </ol>
